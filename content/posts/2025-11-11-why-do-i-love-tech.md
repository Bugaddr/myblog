## Childhood

Hi, I’m **Pranay**. I grew up in **Wani**, a small town in Maharashtra. My father works as an **Electrical Supervisor** at Western Coalfields Limited, and my mother is a **homemaker** with degrees in Sociology and Hindi. My elder brother studied at **IIIT Guwahati** and now works as a **software developer at IBM Pune**.

Our house was always filled with tools, testers, and spare electronic parts. Whenever something broke, my father would fix it himself — and I would be right there beside him, watching every move. That’s how my fascination with electronics began.

### The Switchboard Incident

One afternoon, I saw my father testing a switchboard using a bulb. “Looks simple enough,” I thought.

The moment he left, I decided to try it myself. I grabbed two bare wires, stuck them into the socket, and flipped the switch.

A jolt of electricity surged through me — I couldn’t let go. My mother heard the sparks, rushed in, and did the only thing she could think of: she hit my hands with a rolling pin to break the grip, then turned off the main power, slapped me.

That shock *literally* changed my life. It should have scared me away from electronics, but instead, it made me even more curious about how electricity worked. (And yes, there were a few more “experiments” after that.)

## Discovering the Internet (2011–2012)

Everything changed around **2011–2012**, when my brother bought a 500 MB data pack for our old **Samsung Duos** phone and showed me the internet for the first time. I was instantly hooked.

Soon, my friends and I started pooling money to visit the local internet café. We’d watch **YouTube tutorials at 480p** (that was “HD” back then) and search for electronics project ideas. Afterward, we’d scavenge parts from junk shops — old motors, wires, batteries, broken phones — anything we could find.

By 2 PM every day (before my dad returned from work), I’d be in full maker mode — building small cranes, radios, and RC cars. My grades were average, but my projects made people think I was a genius.

I dreamt of building a drone and an e-bike, but money was tight. I did manage to get an **Arduino Uno**, but had to set it aside for my 9th and 10th board exams.

## Learning Computers

When I was in **Class 5**, my father bought a **Dell i3 laptop** and enrolled me in an **MSCIT course**, which introduced me to the basics of computing.

As internet access improved, I started tweaking **Windows games** to make them run smoother on our low-end PC — unknowingly taking my first steps into programming and system optimization.

## Moving to Software (2019)

After my **10th boards in 2019**, I moved to **Nagpur** for my 11th–12th and JEE prep. My brother needed the laptop for his college work, so all I had was a **Jio Phone running KaiOS**.

That limitation turned out to be a blessing. I got obsessed with figuring out how the phone worked — eventually jailbreaking it and installing custom apps with help from the **BananaHackers** community. That experience sparked my interest in **operating systems**, **Android firmware**, and **bootloaders**.

I practiced on every old smartphone I could find — **Intex Aqua 4G**, **Samsung Galaxy J2**, **Redmi Note 3/4** — opening them up, swapping components, and flashing custom ROMs.

## The COVID-19 Period

When the **COVID-19 lockdown** began, I was back home — this time with good internet and a proper laptop. I used that time to dive deep into **software development** (though my academics took a small hit).

I joined Telegram and Discord tech communities, especially those focused on **custom Android ROMs**. I experimented with **Linux**, tried countless distros, and finally settled on **Arch Linux**.

During this time, I learned:

* Cloud platforms: **GCP, Azure, AWS**
* Building **custom Android ROMs** (CorvusOS, AOSP, PixelExperience)
* **Linux system administration** and **Bash scripting**
* **Cybersecurity fundamentals**

One of my proudest moments was discovering a **security vulnerability in a major company’s OTA update server**, which I responsibly disclosed and received a **bug bounty** for. That’s when I realized — cybersecurity wasn’t just a hobby; it could be a career.

## University Life (2022–Present)

In **November 2022**, I joined the **B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering** program in Nagpur, determined to make the most of it.

I joined the **robotics and aviation clubs**, built multiple robots, and even won  multiple competition. Along the way, I got more involved in:

* **Web development**
* **Cybersecurity and CTF competitions**
* **Hack The Box challenges**
* **Online hacker communities**
* **Leading cybersecurity focused club & attending conferences**

My final year hasn’t been easy — a few emergency room visits and accidents along the way — but I’ve kept pushing. I’ve focused on mastering **data structures and algorithms**, **competitive programming**, and **advanced web development**.

## What’s Next

Right now, I’m looking for opportunities as a **Software Development Engineer** or in **Cybersecurity**. My long-term goal is to work on projects that bridge **hardware and software** — where my passions truly intersect.

From getting shocked by a switchboard as a kid to finding security flaws and building custom ROMs, my journey has been powered by **curiosity**, **experimentation**, and a love for **making things work**.

I’m excited to keep learning, keep building, and hopefully, update this story soon with news about my **first tech job**.
